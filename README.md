# 🧠 Algorithms Collection

Welcome to my **Algorithms** repository! This repo contains classic algorithms implemented in different programming languages, organized by category.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains:
- ✅ Explanation of the algorithm
- ✅ Code implementation (C++ / Java / Python)
- ✅ Common interview questions
- ✅ Practice problems

## 📚 Topics Covered

- 🔢 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- 🔍 Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, etc.)
- 📈 Dynamic Programming
- 📊 Greedy Algorithms
- 📉 Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
- 🧮 Math & Number Theory
- ➗ Divide and Conquer
- 🧩 Recursion & Backtracking

## 🚀 Goals

- Practice data structures & algorithms daily
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews (FAANG, ICPC, etc.)

## 🛠 Languages

- C++
- Java
- Python (coming soon)

## 🤝 Contributions

Feel free to fork the repo and suggest improvements or add new algorithms!
